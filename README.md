# Xeon Newtab Dashboard
I created this page as a test to myself to explore my abilities as a beginner coder.
Something that I would like to continue to work on in the future and perhaps expand upon what I have done already.


## Contents
- Location based Weather [OpenWeatherMap][weather] / Type in any City
- Daily news powered by [Gnews][news]
- Animated customization menu
- Time 12h | 24h
- Background Selector
- Shortcut Dock with 12 shortcuts to social media and most used tech pages.
